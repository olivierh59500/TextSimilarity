Cryptography (English: Cryptography) can be divided into classical cryptography and modern cryptography. In Western European languages, cryptology comes from the Greek krypt s "hidden" and gr phein "writing". Classical cryptography is mainly concerned with the confidentiality of information writing and transmission, as well as its corresponding decoding method. While the modern cryptography not only focus on information security issues, but also relates to information integrity verification (message authentication code), information release non repudiation (digital signature), and all the information security problem in distributed computing from internal and external attacks. An important difference between classical cryptography and modern cryptography is that creativity and skill of classical cryptography encoding and deciphering usually rely on the designer and the adversary, exists as a practical art, and there is no clear definition for the original cryptography. Modern cryptography, however, originated from a large number of related theories in the late twentieth Century, which made modern cryptography a science that can be systematically and rigorously studied.
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics and computer science, and its principle involves a large number of information theory. Ronald Rivest, a famous scholar of cryptography, explains: "cryptography is about how to communicate in the presence of an enemy." from an engineering point of view, this is equivalent to the difference between cryptography and pure mathematics. The development of cryptography promotes the use of computer science, especially in computer and network security, such as access control and confidentiality of information. Cryptography has been used in everyday life: including the IC card, computer users access passwords, e-commerce, etc..
