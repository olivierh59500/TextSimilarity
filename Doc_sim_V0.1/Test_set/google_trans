Cryptography (English: Cryptography) can be divided into classical cryptography and modern cryptography. In Western European languages, the word cryptography comes from the Greek kryptós "hidden", and gráphein "writing". Classical cryptography focuses on the confidentiality of writing and delivery of information, as well as the corresponding deciphering methods. The modern cryptography is not only concerned with the problem of information confidentiality, but also involves information integrity verification (message verification code), non-repudiation of information dissemination (digital signature), and distributed in the calculation of internal and external attacks All information security issues. The important difference between classical cryptography and modern cryptography is that the encoding and deciphering of classical cryptography usually depend on the creativity and skill of designers and adversaries, as a practical art, and there is no clear definition of the original cryptography. And modern cryptography originated in the 20th century, the emergence of a large number of related theories, these theories make modern cryptography has become a systematic and rigorous learning science.
Cryptography is a branch of mathematics and computer science, and its principles involve a lot of information theory. "Cryptography is about how to communicate in an environment where enemies exist," explains Ronald Levist, a well-known cryptographer, from the point of view of engineering, which is equivalent to the difference between cryptography and pure mathematics. The development of cryptography has promoted computer science, especially in the use of computer and network security technologies such as access control and confidentiality of information. Cryptography has been applied in daily life: including ATM chipset, computer user access password, e-commerce and so on.
